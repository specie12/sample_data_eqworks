Assumptions:

	1.	Data was assumed to be based on requests in Canada only

Observations:

	1.	3 POIs situated at distinct provinces as shown in the notebook
	2.	POI3 has and POI2 are the same and has the highest number of requests and it is closest to only two provinces (ON and QC)
	3.	POI4 has the fewest number of requests (477), with requests from the Islands and very few from QC and ON
	4.	POI3 has the highest radius followed by POI1 and the POI4.

Test:

	1.	If the longitude of a point is between -93.45 and -68.52, POI3 is most likely the nearest POI to the point
	2. 	If the longitude of a point is between -136 and -93.33, POI1 is most likely the nearest POI to the point
	3.	If the longitude of a point is between -68.09 and -9.24, POI4 is most likely the nearest POI to the point

NB: Some of the requests were not in Canada as shown in the notebook
